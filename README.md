# local-weather
Displays information on the user's local weather, with options for Fahrenheit and Celsius. Requires access to the user's browser geolocation data. Visit the website [here](https://ntivirikin.github.io/local-weather/).

Created to practice web development fundamentals in unison with freeCodeCamp.

## Roadmap
* Add ability to search for a region rather than default to user's geolocation
